## What Doesn't Work

- **2026-09-29** — Don't format LLM run cost with a flat `.toFixed(2)`: the
  original `formatCost` (`usd == null ? "n/a" : \`$${usd.toFixed(2)}\``,
  removed in commit `d45ab0d`) rounds any sub-cent cost — routine for cheap
  per-call LLM pricing (e.g. $0.0013) — down to `$0.00`, indistinguishable
  from "free" or "no data". Use a precision tier instead: `< $0.01` → 4
  decimals, else 2. See `client/src/lib/format-cost.ts`.

## Codebase Patterns

- **2026-09-29** — This UI uses two visually-similar-but-distinct dash glyphs
  for "empty" states in the same row: en dash `–` (U+2013) for "no data" (e.g.
  `formatCost(null)`) vs em dash `—` (U+2014) for other "n/a" fallbacks (e.g.
  `PRRow.tsx`'s unreviewed-score cell). `screen.getByText("—")` in a test will
  silently miss the en-dash one and vice versa — check which glyph the
  specific component actually renders before asserting on it. Evidence:
  `client/src/lib/format-cost.ts`,
  `client/src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/PRRow/PRRow.tsx`.
